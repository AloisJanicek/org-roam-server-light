* org-roam-server-light
This project is NOT part of official [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] project.
This project started as personal experiment, proof-of-concept and doesn't aspire to become something more then that.
It however uses "org-roam(-server)" name but does it out of good intentions:
1. to make this little experiment easier to find
2. to make the purpose of this project clear

=org-roam-server-light= attempts to move [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server][org-roam-server]] functionality from emacs into external python server process due to subjective poor elisp / emacs performance when computing graph data for larger amount of org-roam files and serving them to web browser.

** Credits
Client side code, assets and some elisp copied as they are from [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server][org-roam-server]]
python code copied and expanded from [[https://github.com/aklatzke/python-webserver-part-2][aklatzke/python-webserver-part-2]]

** Prerequisites
File-preview functionality requires [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]] being available in your PATH

** Installation
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git clone https://github.com/AloisJanicek/org-roam-server-light.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

Add following elisp code into your emacs config and ensure that =org-roam-server-light-dir= points to valid directory

** Elisp code
if you are using doom emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; .doom.d/config.el

(after! org-roam
  ;; OPTIONAL: customize some settings or leave them to their defaults
  ;; enable arrows
  (setq org-roam-server-light-network-vis-options
        "{ \"edges\": { \"arrows\": { \"to\": { \"enabled\": true,\"scaleFactor\": 1.5 } } } }"
        ;; change background color of web application
        org-roam-server-light-style "body.darkmode { background-color: #121212!important; }"
        ;; set default set of excluded or included tags
        ;; customize only the value of id, in this case "test" and "journal"
        org-roam-server-light-default-include-filters "[{ \"id\": \"test\", \"parent\" : \"tags\"  }]"
        org-roam-server-light-default-exclude-filters "[{ \"id\": \"journal\", \"parent\" : \"tags\"  }]"
        )

  ;; MANDATORY: path to your local copy of this repository
  (setq org-roam-server-light-dir "~/org-roam-server-light")

  ;; finally load the main elisp file
  (load! (expand-file-name "org-roam-server-light.el" org-roam-server-light-dir))
  )
#+END_SRC

or if you are using other emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Usage
Running =org-roam-server-light-mode= will start org-roam-server-light server on http://localhost:8080

** TODO Roadmap and functionality overview [8/19]

- [ ] improve org-roam-buffer sidepane
  - add total count of backlinks
- [X] keep track of current buffer
- [X] file previews (basic)
- [ ] improve file previews
  - add CREATED timestamp (?)
- [ ] serve (certain) files linked from exported files
- [ ] serve inline images
- [ ] mark last captured file as current buffer
- [ ] handle citation backlinks in org-roam-buffer sidepane
- [X] serve custom JSON config for vis.Network
  =org-roam-server-light-network-vis-options=
- [ ] ability to customize server url/port via elisp variable
- [X] ability to customize CSS for web app via elisp variable
- [ ] ability to customize CSS for exported files via elisp-variable
- [X] filter items by org-roam tag in web app and ability to set default whitelist/blacklist
  =org-roam-server-light-default-include-filters=
  =org-roam-server-light-default-exclude-filters=
- [ ] review path handling in python code
- [ ] review exported files encoding issues on Windows (cp-1252 vs utf-8 weirdness)
- [ ] review mechanism of sharing data between emacs and python web-server
  currently emacs writes data as text to plain-text files for python web-server to read it
