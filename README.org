* org-roam-server-light
This project is NOT part of official [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] project.
This project started as personal experiment, proof-of-concept and doesn't aspire to become something more then that.
It however uses "org-roam(-server)" name but does it out of good intentions:
1. to make this little experiment easier to find
2. to make the purpose of this project clear

=org-roam-server-light= attempts to move [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server][org-roam-server]] functionality from emacs into external python server process due to subjective poor elisp / emacs performance when computing graph data for larger amount of org-roam files and serving them to web browser.

** Credits
Client side code, assets and some elisp copied as they are from [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server][org-roam-server]]
python code copied and expanded from [[https://github.com/aklatzke/python-webserver-part-2][aklatzke/python-webserver-part-2]]

** Prerequisites
File-preview functionality requires [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]] being available in your PATH

** Installation
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git clone https://github.com/AloisJanicek/org-roam-server-light.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

Add following elisp code into your emacs config and ensure that =org-roam-server-light-dir= points to valid directory

** Elisp code
if you are using doom emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; .doom.d/config.el

(after! org-roam
  ;; optionally customize vis.Network options
  (setq org-roam-server-light-network-vis-options
        "{ \"edges\": { \"arrows\": { \"to\": { \"enabled\": true,\"scaleFactor\": 1.5 } } } }"
        )

  ;; set the directory where you cloned this repository
  (setq org-roam-server-light-dir "~/org-roam-server-light")

  ;; finally load the main elisp file
  (load! (expand-file-name "org-roam-server-light.el" org-roam-server-light-dir))
  )
#+END_SRC

or if you are using other emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; .emacs.d/init.el

(eval-after-load 'org-roam
  ;; optionally customize vis.Network options
  (setq org-roam-server-light-network-vis-options
        "{ \"edges\": { \"arrows\": { \"to\": { \"enabled\": true,\"scaleFactor\": 1.5 } } } }"
        )

  ;; set the directory where you cloned this repository
  (setq org-roam-server-light-dir "~/org-roam-server-light")

  ;; finally load the main elisp file
  (load (expand-file-name "org-roam-server-light.el" org-roam-server-light-dir))
  )
#+END_SRC
** Usage
Running =org-roam-server-light-mode= will start org-roam-server-light server on http://localhost:8080
